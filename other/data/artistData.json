After graduating from high school, he graduated only later, in 1980, at the mimodrama school of the Teatro Arsenale in Milan. At the beginning of the eighties he began his career as a stand-up comrade with Giovanni Storti, with whom he formed a comic duo for about ten years, until 1991.\n\nIn 1985, and for a few more years, he performed in the theater at the Palmasera Village Resort in Cala Gonone, Sardinia, together with Marina Massironi, Giacomo Poretti and Giovanni Storti. With the latter he then formed a duo called \"I suggestionabili\". The group also found space for Stefano Belisari (Elio and the Storie Tese) as DJs, Giorgio Porcaro, Mario Zucca, Marino Guidi, Eraldo Moretto and other comedians of the following success. In that year the association with Giacomo Poretti was born, together with which Storti and Baglio founded the trio Aldo, Giovanni & Giacomo (previously called Galline Vecchie Fan Buon Brothers)."

He worked in Sardinia (in 1985 continuing for some years to follow) at the Palmasera Village Resort in Cala Gonone together with Marina Massironi, Aldo and Giacomo. At the time, with Aldo, he formed a duo called I suggestionabili (the name of the duo La Carovana was denied by Storti during the transmission of Rai 3 Kilimanjaro on 2 December 2018). That same group also saw very young Stefano Belisari (Elio and the Storie Tese) as DJs, Giorgio Porcaro, Mario Zucca, Marino Guidi, Eraldo Moretto and others.\n\nBeyond this, there is the teaching activity of theatrical acrobatics at the Civic School of Dramatic Art of Milan and the care of the movements of the show Pugacev by Franco Branciaroli. In 1989 he was director of the show Non parole but contundenti objects written by Giacomo. As can be deduced from the trio films, Giovanni is a great Inter fan.

Between the ages of 8 and 11 he began acting, unsuccessfully trying to join the I Legnanesi company. He abandoned his studies as a surveyor to go to work in the factory as a metalworker; at its closure, at the age of 18, to avoid military service, he entered the Legnano Civil Hospital as a nurse. Meanwhile he devoted himself to cabaret and political protest, actively engaging with Proletarian Democracy.\n\nHe worked for the next 11 years as a nurse, and in 1983 he graduated from the Busto Arsizio theater school.

    "desc": "Lorenzo Cherubini (born 27 September 1966), better known as Jovanotti (Italian pronunciation: [dʒovaˈnɔtti]), is an Italian singer-songwriter and rapper.\n\nThe name Jovanotti derives from the plural form of the Italian word giovanotto (\"young man\"), i.e., giovanotti. Cherubini initially chose \"Joe Vanotti\" as his stage name, but a promotional poster for a night club incorrectly billed him as \"Jovanotti\" and the name stuck. (The spelling Jovanotti is anglicized; the letter J is rarely used in Italian) Jovanotti is commonly known to his fans by the diminutive form \"Jova\", and often refers to himself that way in promotional items and on his Web TV channel Jova.TV, which launched October 2, 2014.\n\nJovanotti gradually departed from his early mix of hip hop, rap and disco, taking in funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so did his lyrics too, which over time began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian cantautore tradition. His social and political commitment increased as well. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop.\n\nMost of his songs are sung in Italian; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight.\" Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed \"I Got Rhythm\". Jovanotti also appeared in one of Luciano Pavarotti's charity concerts in 1996."

He has recorded over a hundred complete operas and is well known for his versatility, regularly performing in Italian, French, German, Spanish, English and Russian in the most prestigious opera houses in the world. Although primarily a lirico-spinto tenor for most of his career, especially popular for his Cavaradossi, Hoffmann, Don José, and Canio, he quickly moved into more dramatic roles, becoming the most acclaimed Otello of his generation. In the early 2010s, he transitioned from the tenor repertory into almost exclusively baritone parts, most notably Simon Boccanegra. He has performed 149 different roles.\n\nDomingo has also achieved significant success as a crossover artist, especially in the genres of Latin and popular music. In addition to winning fourteen Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, several of his records have gone silver, gold, platinum and multi-platinum. His first pop album, Perhaps Love (1981), spread his fame beyond the opera world. The title song, performed as a duet with country and folk singer John Denver, has sold almost four million copies and helped lead to numerous television appearances for the tenor. He also starred in many cinematically released and televised opera movies, particularly under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli. In 1990, he began singing with fellow tenors Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras as part of The Three Tenors. The first Three Tenors recording became the best-selling classical album of all time."

He made numerous recordings of complete operas and individual arias, gaining worldwide fame for the quality of his tone, and eventually established himself as one of the finest tenors of the 20th century, achieving the honorific title \"king of the high C's\".\n\nAs one of the Three Tenors who performed their first concert during the 1990 FIFA World Cup before a global audience, Pavarotti became well known for his televised concerts and media appearances. From the beginning of his professional career as a tenor in 1961 in Italy to his final performance of \"Nessun dorma\" at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Pavarotti was at his best in bel canto operas, pre-Aida Verdi roles, and Puccini works such as La bohème, Tosca, Turandot and Madama Butterfly. He sold over 100 million records, and the first Three Tenors recording became the best-selling classical album of all time. Pavarotti was also noted for his charity work on behalf of refugees and the Red Cross, amongst others. He died from pancreatic cancer on 6 September 2007."
