## Specification

### Web Architecture
Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application
and how they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application
layer, data layer or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is
not rendered server side?

### API

#### REST compliance
Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.

-- Our API follow 4 of the 5 guiding principles of a REST interface:
1) Contract first approach: it provides lot of URLs to get every information stored in our database, filtering them by 
their discriminating values, efficiently making a point of contact between server and frontend. It also provides URLs
used for important user interactions like registering and logging, covering all principal website functionality.
2) Statelessness: every API call provide complete information about object data transfered. If any object related to
fetched object is needed it could easily be fetched with a proper call, with this method there is less message overhead
when this additional info are not required.
3) Client-Server model: API are largely documented and provide a clear schema of data
provided, so that data can be easily retrieved by client side. Data format is not very granular
because our website data is pretty simple, but there is a lot of API calls granularity to
provide optimized calls for every situation.
4) Caching: caching is not supported by our API since it's not a requirement of the course
and because our data is quite simple, so response time is small enough even without it.
5) Layered architecture: our website use a standard 3-tier architecture. Client communicate
with server hosting the backend code that handles API calls, API code instead interrogate the data layer
to fetch the data that clients require to display the pages.

#### OpenAPI Resource models
Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for
resources.

### Data model
Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?

## Implementation

### Tools used
Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the
backend of the application.

-- For backend server we used javascript in a node.js environment, developed upon a
stub server generated by swagger editor. Swagger is a core component of our server, as
a framework for handling API calls and provide proper documentation in an easy way. Other
important npm packages used in the projects are serve-static for handling static assets
and cookie-parser and cookie-session for handling login with cookies. 

### Discussion
Describe here:
- How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
OpenAPI specification? Which method did you use to test all APIs
endpoints against the expected response?
- Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
partition a REST-based web application (static assets vs.
application data)
- Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state,
what are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login
etc..).
- Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for
managing the data model?
-- We used a relational database (postgreSQL) for the data model,
because we are more experienced with a traditional SQL database
explained in our faculty courses.

## Other information

### Task assignment
Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members
of the group, e.g.:
> - Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)
> - Bar worked on ....

### Analysis of existing API
Describe here the research of (full or part of) existing APIs that are similar
in objectives and scope to the one implemented, that have possibly guided
implementation choices (these should not be necessarily OpenAPI
implementations). Toy APIs (such as the Swagger's Pet Store) or the example
shown during lectures are not a valid response.
Use TWO or more items of the form:
> We took (full/partial) inspiration from API <XYZ>(link) for the part of the
> API that manages <ABC> because of <REASON>.
Or
> For the part of the API that manages <ABC> we considered/studied <XYZ>(link)
> because of <REASON> but wasn't completely fitting to our purpose because of
> <REASON>.

### Learning outcome
What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?

Examples:
- Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know
more about caching, he's probably going to create his own startup
with what she has learned
- Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked
to know more about promises for asynchronous code..
